Development playground from the treehouse course (that I keep updating for exercise).

Ruby 2.0.0p247

Rails 4.0.0

###On Heroku###

Also available on Heroku:
http://fathomless-anchorage-4126.herokuapp.com/

Of course trying to use the methods that send emails won't work in Heroku (at least for now, it ask for my credit card to use a free of charge addon)

pro-tip: to deploy on Heroku it is best to always use the most recent version of ruby and rails.
