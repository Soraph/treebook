========

Development playground from the treehouse course.

Ruby 1.9.3p374

Rails 3.2.15

Kinda old!

Planning to update dependencies to the latest version.

###On Heroku###

Also available on Heroku:
http://fathomless-anchorage-4126.herokuapp.com/

Of course trying to use the methods that send emails won't work in Heroku (at least for now, it ask for my credit card to use a free of charge addon)

pro-tip: to deploy on Heroku it is best to always use the most recent version of ruby and rails.
